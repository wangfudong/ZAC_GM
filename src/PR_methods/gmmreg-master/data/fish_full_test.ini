# The alignment is done by moving the 'model' towards the fixed 'scene'
# Usually the point set with less points is chosen as the 'model'.

# 'ctrl_pts' serve as the control points when thin plate splines (TPS) or
# Gaussian radial basis functions (GRBF) are used in the nonrigid registration

[GMMREG_OPT]
# This section configures parameters used in the point set registration methods
# that minimize similarity measures between two Gaussian mixtures corresponding
# to the two point sets by directly employing numerical optimization.
#
# The two representative references are:
#   Yanghai Tsin and Takeo Kanade,
#   A Correlation-Based Approach to Robust Point Set Registration,
#   ECCV (3) 2004: 558-569.
#
#   Bing Jian and Baba C. Vemuri,
#   A Robust Algorithm for Point Set Registration Using Mixture of Gaussians,
#   ICCV 2005, pp. 1246-1251.
#
# Currently, 2D/3D rigid registration and nonrigid registration using thin plate
# splines (TPS) model are supported for above methods.

# if the 'normalize' flag is nonzero, normalization is done before the registration
normalize = 1

# multiscale option, this number should be no more than the
# number of parameters given in options below
level = 0

# the scale parameters of Gaussian mixtures, from coarse to fine,

# weights of the regularization term, e.g. the TPS bending energy
lambda = 0 0 0 0

# to fix the affine or not during optimization at each level

# the max number of function evaluations at each level

[GMMREG_EM]
# This section configures parameters used in the point set registration methods
# based on the EM framework.

#  A new point matching algorithm for non-rigid registration,
#  Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 2003, 89(2-3), pp. 114-141.

#  Non-rigid Point Set Registration: Coherent Point Drift,
#  NIPS 2006, pp. 1009-1016.
#
# Currently only 2D/3D nonrigid registation have been implemented based on above two methods.
# Note that in Chui and Rangrajan (2000) the thin plate splines (TPS) model is used while the
# Gaussian radial basis functions (GRBF) model is used in Myronenko et al. (2006).

# if the 'normalize' flag is nonzero, normalization is done before the registration
normalize = 1
