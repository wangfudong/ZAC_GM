Description:
This website hosts implementations of the robust point set registration
algorithm discribed in the following ICCV'05 paper:
 A Robust Algorithm for Point Set Registration Using Mixture of Gaussians,
 Bing Jian and Baba C. Vemuri,
 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV 2005),
 17-20 October 2005, Beijing, China, pp. 1246-1251.

Currently we provide the implementations in C++, MATLAB, and Python, with full
source code. You can download the source code for free, use and change it as
you like, but please refer to this webpage and cite our paper.
