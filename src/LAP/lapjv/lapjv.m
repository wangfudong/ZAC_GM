function [rowsol,cost,v,u,costMat] = lapjv(costMat,resolution)
% LAPJV  Jonker-Volgenant Algorithm for Linear Assignment Problem.
%
% [ROWSOL,COST,v,u,rMat] = LAPJV(COSTMAT, resolution) returns the optimal column indices,
% ROWSOL, assigned to row in solution, and the minimum COST based on the
% assignment problem represented by the COSTMAT, where the (i,j)th element
% represents the cost to assign the jth job to the ith worker.
% The second optional input can be used to define data resolution to
% accelerate speed.
% Other output arguments are:
% v: dual variables, column reduction numbers.
% u: dual variables, row reduction numbers.
% rMat: the reduced cost matrix.
%
% For a rectangular (nonsquare) costMat, rowsol is the index vector of the
% larger dimension assigned to the smaller dimension.
%
% [ROWSOL,COST,v,u,rMat] = LAPJV(COSTMAT,resolution) accepts the second
% input argument as the minimum resolution to differentiate costs between
% assignments. The default is eps.
%
% Known problems: The original algorithm was developed for integer costs.
% When it is used for real (floating point) costs, sometime the algorithm
% will take an extreamly long time. In this case, using a reasonable large
% resolution as the second arguments can significantly increase the
% solution speed.
