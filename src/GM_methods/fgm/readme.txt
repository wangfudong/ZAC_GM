============
Introduction
============
    This page contains software and instructions for factorized graph matching (FGM) [1] [2].
    In addition, we include the following well-known methods as baselines:

	  spectral matching (SM) [3],
      spectral matching with affine constraints (SMAC) [4],
      graduated assignment (GA) [5],
	  probabilistic matching (PM) [6],
	  integer projected fixed point method (IPFP) [7],
      re-weighted random walk matching (RRWM) [8].

    The implementations of the above methods are taken from the authors' websites.


============
Installation
============
    1. unzip "fgm.zip" to your folder;
    2. Run "make" to compile all C++ files;
    3. Run "addPath" to add sub-directories into the path of Matlab.
    4. Run "demoXXX" or "testXXX".


============
Instructions
============
    The package of "fgm.zip" contains the following files and folders:

    ./data: This folder contains the CMU House Image dataset.

    ./save: This folder contains the experimental results reported in the paper.

    ./src: This folder contains the main implmentation of FGM as well as other baselines.

    ./lib: This folder contains some necessary library functions.

    ./make.m: Matlab makefile for C++ code.

    ./addPath.m: Adds the sub-directories into the path of Matlab.

    ./demoToy.m: A demo comparison of different graph matching methods on the synthetic dataset.

    ./demoHouse.m: A demo comparison of different graph matching methods on the on CMU House dataset.
  
    ./testToy.m: Testing the performance of different graph matching methods on the synthetic dataset.
                 This is a similar function used for reporting (Fig. 4) the first experiment (Sec 5.1) in the CVPR 2012 paper

    ./testHouse.m Testing the performance of different graph matching methods on CMU House Image dataset.
			      This is the same function used for reporting (Fig. 4) the first experiment (Sec 5.1) in the CVPR 2013 paper.

C++ Code
========
    In order to achieve efficiency, we provide several C++ codes under
    "src/asg/fgm/matrix" for performing matrix products between
    binary matrices. For instance, the function "multiGXH.cpp" is used
    to more efficiently compute the matrix product, "G^T * X * H", where G and H
    are two binary matrices.
