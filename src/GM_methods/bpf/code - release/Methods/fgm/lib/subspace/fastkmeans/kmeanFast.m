function [centers, mincenter, mindist, q2, quality] = kmeanFast(data, initcenters, method)
% Fast k-means.
% 
% Input
%   data  -  data points
%   initcenters  -  initial centers
% if initcenters is a number k, create k centers and start with these
% otherwise, use centers given as input
%   method  0: unoptimized, using n by k matrix of distances O(nk) space
%          1: vectorized, using only O(n+k) space
%          2: like 1, in addition using distance inequalities (default)
%
% Output
%   final centers
